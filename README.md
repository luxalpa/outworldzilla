This project features four different minigames designed to train your skills at Dota 2.

Unfortunately it is outdated.

For revitalizing this project things need to be reworked:
- The name of the project could be more fitting 
- Migrate the entire code to using Vue instead of Angular 2 Beta
- Migrate to modern TypeScript
- Switch from Gulp+Rollup to Webpack / Vue-CLI
- Improve the color scheme and apply what we learned about UI/UX design to make it look much better.
